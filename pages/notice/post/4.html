            <h1 class="post-title">Pokémon TCG Dragapult VMAX Deck Strategy</h1>
            <article class="full-article-body">
                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">
                    Dragapult VMAX Basics</h1>

                <img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
                     src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/cards/site_search/SWSH2/SWSH2_EN_93.png" alt="">

                <p>At first glance, this card might look pretty simple, but don't let yourself
                    get fooled—there are a plethora of ways to play it. Dragapult VMAX has two
                    attacks, including its quick Shred attack that does 60 damage for just 1
                    Psychic Energy and ignores all effects. But its second attack is where Dragapult
                    VMAX really shines: for only 2 Psychic Energy, Max Phantom does an astounding
                    130 damage to the Active Pokémon, plus you can put 5 damage counters on your
                    opponent's Bench however you like. It is important to note that Max Phantom places
                    damage counters, rather than doing direct damage, or else the very popular
                    Mew
                    would quickly shut this card down.</p>

                <p>So, what exactly is it that makes this card so strong? Let's start with
                    the obvious. Dragapult VMAX's 320 HP makes it a big hurdle to Knock Out in one
                    hit for virtually any deck. Combined with the low Energy requirements we
                    mentioned before, you will have time to prepare a second Dragapult VMAX on the Bench
                    while already swinging away with the first one you put in play.</p>

                <p>Dragapult VMAX is a Psychic-type Pokémon, meaning it can be retrieved by
                    Mysterious Treasure, an incredible Item
                    card for Pokémon-searching. This card makes it much easier to consistently get
                    this Pokémon VMAX on the field compared with other Pokémon VMAX in the format.</p>

                <p>Having Weakness to Darkness is also very good right now, as Darkness types
                    see next to no play in the competitive setting at the moment, except for Spiritomb.
                    Luckily for Dragapult VMAX,
                    Spiritomb naturally struggles with Max Phantom, making this matchup much closer
                    than you might initially think.</p>

                <p>With cost-effective attacks, the damage value you get back for the
                    resources required is high. You invest two Energy attachments to get 130 damage
                    plus 5 damage counters spread to the Bench, effectively doing 180 damage every
                    turn with no obvious drawbacks—and as long as your opponent doesn't stop you,
                    you can use the same attack over and over until you win. You can start using
                    Max Phantom consistently on the second turn of the game, which is simply
                    incredible.</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">
                    Support for Dragapult VMAX</h1>

                <p>After looking at all these factors, we can easily understand that this
                    card could make a big splash in the metagame, but let's dive deeper into the
                    different tricks we have available for this card.</p>

                <img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
                     src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/cards/site_search/SWSH2/SWSH2_EN_172.png" alt="">

                <p>The first card to look at is Horror Psychic Energy, also from the
                    <em>Sword &amp; Shield—Rebel Clash </em>expansion. If
                    the Pokémon it's attached to gets hit by an attack, the attacker takes a little
                    damage, too. Since you will have to attach Energy manually anyway, you might as
                    well attach an Energy with a bonus effect as strong as the one Horror Psychic Energy
                    provides if you can. Every bit of damage will help you, and since Dragapult VMAX
                    is such a tank, your opponent will most likely have to hit it at least twice to
                    take it down, which activates Horror Psychic Energy twice as well.</p>

                <p>Another new card that helps this Pokémon greatly is Boss's
                    Orders. Since you can have so much control over
                    Max Phantom's damage output, you can make sure not to waste damage by hitting an
                    Active Pokémon that has low HP remaining with the full 130 damage. Rather, use
                    Boss's Orders to push that heavily damaged Pokémon to the Bench and finish it
                    off there instead, while directing the main damage of Max Phantom toward a
                    fresh target. Normally, using a Supporter card that does not draw cards is not
                    well advised, but since Dragapult VMAX requires minimal resources, you should be
                    able to afford to use Boss's Orders quite often.</p>

                <p>You could also use Phione to force
                    your opponent to switch out their Active Pokémon. In some situations, the only
                    thing that matters for you is that you can push a damaged target out of the
                    Active Spot; it doesn't matter what Pokémon takes its place. It will also free you
                    up to use a different Supporter card on your turn.</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">
                    Get the Scoop</h1>

                <img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
                     src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/cards/site_search/SWSH2/SWSH2_EN_165.png" alt="">

                <p>The newly released Scoop Up Net breathes
                    new life into a lot of powerful Abilities triggered when the Pokémon comes into
                    play. In the past, many of these cards could not be played effectively since they
                    would clog up your Bench. Scoop Up Net fixes this problem and even lets you
                    reuse those Abilities multiple times if needed.</p>

                <p><a rel="imagepopup" href="/us/pokemon-tcg/pokemon-cards/ss-series/swsh1/117/" target="_self"
                      src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/cards/web/SWSH1/SWSH1_EN_117.png"
                      alt="Galarian Zigzagoon">Galarian Zigzagoon</a> is a great
                    partner for Dragapult VMAX, giving you a little extra damage boost when you desperately
                    need it with its Headbutt Tantrum Ability. This card is enhanced massively with
                    Scoop Up Net, letting you use the Ability multiple times. For example, with it you
                    could Knock Out a Benched Jirachi in a
                    single turn. Jirachi is played in almost every competitive deck at the moment
                    in some capacity, and Dragapult VMAX loves to play against this card. Since
                    Jirachi only has 70 HP, Dragapult VMAX can very easily snipe it off the Bench
                    in a turn or two while continuing to damage the main attacker, quickly giving you
                    an advantage in the Prize race.</p>

                <p>>Giratina
                    can provide help similar
                    to Galarian Zigzagoon; it has to start in your discard pile, and it only does
                    damage to your opponent's Benched Pokémon, but its Distortion Door Ability can
                    hit <em>2</em> targets with 1 damage counter instead. With a combination of Mysterious
                    Treasure and Quick Ball, it should be relatively easy to discard Giratina
                    and
                    use Distortion Door. Then you can pick up Giratina with Scoop Up Net to start
                    the process over.</p>

                <p>These two great options for Dragapult VMAX are good enough reasons for
                    including Scoop Up Net. And yet another use for it that has suddenly become
                    more reliable is Oranguru + Jirachi Prism Star + Mr.
                        Mime. You can put Jirachi Prism Star on top of
                    your deck with Oranguru, then use Mr. Mime to swap it with 1 of your Prize
                    cards. Then you can “steal” a Prize card whenever you take your next Knock Out.
                    This is something you could add into any deck in theory, but it is especially
                    good in this deck. To make this combo work, you do need three Basic Pokémon at
                    the same time. The Mysterious Treasure you're already including in this deck can
                    pick up Mr. Mime, making it much easier for you to assemble the three pieces to
                    make it work.</p>

                <p>One more use for Scoop Up Net can come in handy in later situations. Normally,
                    if you get stuck midgame with a dead hand, you can use a Quick Ball to get Dedenne-<em>GX</em>
                    to get out of that
                    situation. But with this deck, you can use Mysterious Treasure to get Mewtwo as
                    well, giving you a much greater
                    chance of finding what you need. Together with Oranguru, you can put a Supporter
                    card from the discard pile right into your hand to get you out of sticky
                    situations. Later, you can use Scoop Up Net to get the same effect again if
                    needed. This combination is also a great way to close out games by letting you
                    get a game-winning Boss's Orders.</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">
                    Dealing with the Opposition</h1>

                <p>One of the best ways to slow down Dragapult VMAX is to take advantage of
                    it needing two Energy attachments to use its best attack. A strong card for
                    this purpose is Giratina, a great way
                    to get rid of Horror Psychic Energy and slow down Dragapult VMAX. This in
                    combination with Crushing Hammer and
                    Team Yell Grunt will be strong
                    against Dragapult VMAX decks. </p>

                <img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
                     src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/cards/site_search/SM6/SM6_EN_51.png" alt="">

                <p>The countermeasure to this is to play a couple copies of Malamar. You won't need
                    more than one on the field,
                    and it also has synergy with Mysterious Treasure, making it easy to set up. Using
                    Malamar isn't always necessary, but if you are anticipating a lot of Energy
                    removal, this is the best option to counteract that. Going the Malamar route,
                    adding Super Scoop Up in addition to
                    the Scoop Up Nets could also be very strong, as it would allow you to sometimes
                    completely heal your Dragapult VMAX and send it right back up to attack again
                    thanks to Malamar giving you the extra Energy attachment. Super Scoop Up also has
                    great synergy with all the “comes into play” Abilities, just like Scoop Up Net.</p>

                <p>Talking about Scoop Ups, there's one card that could make or break the
                    mirror matchup, especially if both Super Scoop Up and Scoop Up Net are
                    involved. It's another Mr. Mime, this
                    time from <em>Sun &amp; Moon—Team Up</em>, that completely blocks your opponent
                    from using these cards on any damaged Pokémon. One of the annoying things about
                    playing Dragapult VMAX could be the hardship of navigating around your opponent's
                    Scoop Up Nets and Super Scoop Up. With this Mr. Mime, all you would need to do
                    is simply put at least 1 damage counter on everything on your opponent's side
                    that you don't want to see disappear. Playing this card also allows you to put
                    all 5 damage counters on a Jirachi without having to worry that your opponent
                    uses Scoop Up Net or Super Scoop Up the following turn to negate a big portion
                    of your attack. Mr. Mime is even a Psychic type, making it an incredibly good
                    option for Dragapult VMAX.</p>

                <p>There's a good reason players have cut back on Switch lately and instead
                    rely more on Scoop Up Net: having a combination of Mr. Mime and Absol on your
                    Bench could make your opponent's engine
                    completely stop working.</p>

                <br>

                    Power Tools</h1>

                <img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;"
                     src="https://assets.pokemon.com//assets/cms2/img/cards/site_search/SM8/SM8_EN_190.png" alt="">

                <p>As for Pokémon Tool cards, I focus on being able to pick up extra damage
                    wherever possible. For this deck, we have a couple of very decent options in Spell
                        Tag and Giant Bomb. Since we are giving away three Prize cards
                    each time a Dragapult VMAX is Knocked Out, Spell Tag will most likely only be activated
                    once a game, but it is very flexible in this deck because you can always play
                    it down the turn you get it. It fits the overall strategy of Dragapult VMAX greatly
                    by being able to get those few extra damage counters you might need. Giant Bomb
                    is similar—it comes with a somewhat better effect for the format at the moment,
                    but it requires more timing on when to play it and could clunk up your early
                    turns.</p>

                <p>You could also go for a more unconventional option and play Big Charm to
                    elevate Dragapult VMAX to a whopping 350
                    HP, giving decks like Spiritomb and Boltund V a lot
                    more trouble when trying to
                    take the Pokémon out in one hit. Another big perk of Big Charm is that it makes
                    sure opposing Dragapult VMAX will have a harder time Knocking Out your support
                    Pokémon like Inkay and Jirachi.</p>

                <p>Finally, the Stadium cards that best complement Dragapult VMAX are Shrine
                    of Punishment and Viridian Forest. Shrine of Punishment makes
                    targeting
                    Dedenne-<em>GX</em> an even easier task, and Viridian Forest has great synergy
                    with Malamar and Giratina.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Dragapult VMAX benefits greatly from being a Psychic type, thus having
                    access to a lot of great supporting choices in Pokémon, Trainers, and Energy.
                    The card has an easy time targeting down your opponent's support Pokémon like the
                    popular Dedenne-<em>GX</em> and Jirachi, making it very easy to close out games
                    quickly. Because it's very efficient in what it tries to do and has so many
                    viable options, we could see a wide variety of Dragapult VMAX decks, and they
                    could all do great at tournaments.</p>

                <p>Best of luck in your next tournament with Dragapult VMAX at your side! For more Pokémon TCG analysis,
