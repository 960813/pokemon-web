            <article class="full-article-body">



                <p><span style="float: left; font-size: 530%; line-height: 80%; color: #30a7d7; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: -5px;"><strong>T</strong></span>he Kalos region calls to Ash and Pikachu, as the pair
                    continue their journey in <em>Pokémon the Series: XY</em>, which has just arrived
                    on Pokémon TV. Ash is joined by a young inventor named
                    Clemont and his little sister Bonnie. They also befriend another Pokémon
                    Trainer named Serena, who is just setting out on her first adventure. Check out
                    some of the exciting events that happen during the course of this season, and
                    then tune in to Pokémon TV to see the whole story!</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">The Power of Mega Evolution</h1>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../../static/image/01.jpg" alt="">

                <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 12px;">While in the Kalos region, Ash meets Professor Sycamore, who has been
                    researching Pokémon Evolution, including a powerful phenomenon known as Mega
                    Evolution. This incredible feat allows a fully evolved Pokémon to undergo a
                    special temporary Evolution before returning to its previous form. To do so,
                    however, a Pokémon and its Trainer must have a strong bond and an item called a
                    Mega Stone (“Lumiose City Pursuit!”). Throughout the course of the season, Ash
                    and his friends will encounter multiple Mega-Evolved Pokémon, including Mega
                    Gardevoir (“The Aura Storm!”). Towards the end of the season, our
                    heroes even learn the origins of Mega Evolution (the aptly titled “Origins of Mega Evolution!”).</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">Ash Goes for the Bug Badge</h1>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../../static/image/02.jpg" alt="">

                <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 12px;">A new region means a new set of Gym badges for Ash to earn. Of course,
                    in order to do that, he's going to have to take on the region's Gym Leaders!
                    His first challenge arises when he makes it to Santalune City. When Ash and his
                    friends arrive in the city, they meet a helpful photographer: Viola, the
                    Santalune City Gym Leader. Viola favors Bug-type Pokémon, and her Surskit's Ice
                    Beam covers the ground with a slippery layer of ice (“A Blustery Santalune Gym Battle!”). After an unsuccessful attempt to defeat
                    Viola, Ash's confidence is shaken. A surprise reunion with a forgotten
                    acquaintance reminds Ash that he must remain determined in order to come out on
                    top. Newly inspired, Ash and Pikachu return to face Viola again (“Battling on Thin Ice!”).</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">Team Rocket's New Pokémon</h1>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../../static/image/03.jpg" alt="">

                <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 12px;">Ash and his friends may be the stars of <em>Pokémon the Series: XY</em>,
                    but their adventures wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if the meddlesome Team
                    Rocket weren't constantly showing up with another twisted scheme. And while we
                    can always count on Meowth and Wobbuffet to join Jessie and James on their
                    escapades, it's always fun to see what other Pokémon these troublemakers add to
                    their team. The first addition this season comes in the form of a hungry Inkay
                    who can't stop swiping Team Rocket's food. It doesn't take much more than a
                    quick distraction with a sandwich for James to catch the sneaky Pokémon (“A Battle of Aerial Mobility!”). Later, Jessie literally stumbles across
                    a new friend when she trips over a Pumpkaboo, which she promptly catches (“The Bamboozling Forest!”). Despite their villainous intent, Jessie
                    and James have repeatedly proven themselves to be caring Pokémon Trainers, so
                    it's not surprising that Inkay and Pumpkaboo become loyal to the nefarious duo.</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">Take to the Sky</h1>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../../static/image/04.jpg" alt="">

                <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 12px;">Upon arriving at Kalos Canyon, Ash and friends see their very first Sky
                    Battle. These exciting matches involve two flying Pokémon battling in midair
                    while their Trainers fly alongside them wearing wing suits. Of course, Ash is
                    eager to try it out, and he accepts a challenge from Sky Battle instructor Moria
                    and her Pokémon partner Talonflame. Ash's Fletchling is ready to fly into
                    action, but Talonflame refuses to battle such a tiny opponent. Ash's Hawlucha is
                    happy to step in—but the brave Fletchling might prove to be a valuable teammate
                    before this battle is finished (“Battles in the Sky!”).</p>

                <br>

                <h1 style="font-family: Flexo-Medium; font-size: 150%; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 3px; border-bottom: 3px solid #30A7D7;">Ash Goes to Camp</h1>

                <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="../../../static/image/05.jpg" alt="">

                <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 12px;">Get ready for a week of fun, friends, and bonding with your Pokémon
                    when Ash and his friends attend Professor Sycamore's annual Pokémon summer
                    camp! While there, Ash makes even more friends including Tierno and his
                    Squirtle, Trevor and his Charmander, and Shauna and her Bulbasaur. Of course,
                    Team Rocket is on the scene as well, disguised as camp chefs (“Summer of Discovery!”). Exciting escapades ensue when the
                    campers are split into teams to film their own Pokévision videos (“Day Three Blockbusters!”) and to go on a trek to collect stamps by
                    visiting checkpoints on a map (“Foggy Pokémon Orienteering!”). Of course, the big attraction is the
                    Team Battle competition, where teams of campers must work together and combine
                    their Pokémon's moves to win (“Battling into the Hall of Fame!”). Who will come out on top?</p>
